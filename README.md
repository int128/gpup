$ gpup my-photos/
2018/06/14 10:28:40 The following 2 files will be uploaded:
  1: my-photos/travel.jpg
  2: my-photos/lunch.jpg
2018/06/14 10:28:40 Open http://localhost:8000 for authorization
2018/06/14 10:28:43 GET /
2018/06/14 10:28:49 GET /?state=...&code=...

```

It opens the browser and you can log in to the provider.
And then it uploads files concurrently.

You can specify URLs as well.

```sh
gpup https://www.example.com/image.jpg
```

You can also read files from stdin by specifying `-` as the path.

```sh
cat list_of_files | gpup -
```

### Upload files to an album

You can upload files to the album by `-a` option.
If the album does not exist, it will be created.

```sh
gpup -a "My Album" my-photos/
```

You can upload files to a new album by `-n` option.

```sh
gpup -n "My Album" my-photos/
```

## Known issues

See [the Google Issue Tracker](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues?q=componentid:385336%20status:open) for the known issues.

### Timestamp

If you upload an photo or movie without timestamp in the header, timestamp of the image will be current time.
Google Photos Library API does not provide setting timestamp for now.

### Photo storage and quality

By using gpup, files are uploaded in original quality, which consumes user's storage. It's the limitation of Photos Library API, as stated in [the offical document](https://developers.google.com/photos/library/guides/api-limits-quotas).

```
All media items uploaded to Google Photos using the API are stored in full resolution at original quality. They count toward the userâ€™s storage.
```

A workaround for this is to use [recover storage feature](https://support.google.com/photos/answer/6220791) of Google Photos, which lets you free up the storage space by converting all the files uploaded in original quality to high quality.
